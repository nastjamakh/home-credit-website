               <p>End-to-end ML product to predict probability of default on a home credit loan.</p>

                <p>The projects demonstrates product development in stages, attempting to show how it
                would have been developed over time in “real world”.
                We start with understanding the business problem and goals to brainstorm a sufficient
                solution, and proceed to build a heuristic solution.
                This has an advantage of being easy to implement compared to Machine Learning approaches, 
                while still proving a great values at least by automating human decision-making and reducing costs. 
                We discuss how end users might use our model and provide an appropriate way to put it in production.</p>

                <p>Then we proceed with a more advanced ML solution that requires both more time investment
                on feature engineering and more cloud resources for training.
                Once this version is deployed, we focus on MLOps to make our product
                easier to maintain and develop forward with additions like testing,
                logging, alerting, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring and others.</p>

                <p>Although we try to imitate real-world scenario as much as possible, there are,
                of course, certain constraints. One, some tools exist only as Enterprise solutions
                and are thus unavailable for an open source project.
                Two, we load data from static files, not from DWH, meaning it does not change over time.
                Three, we do not separate staging and production environment, operating only in one,
                due to financial restrictions. In all these cases we provide suggestions on how it
                could be implemented, absent our limitations.</p>
